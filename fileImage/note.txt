Steps for Image Upload in PHP

    Check if the request method is POST:
        Verify that the file upload process begins only with a POST request.

    Define an upload directory:
        Set the directory where uploaded files will be stored (e.g., "upload/").
        Ensure the directory path ends with a slash (/).

    Retrieve the uploaded file's name:
        Use basename() to safely extract the file name.

    Set allowed MIME types:
        Define a list of acceptable image MIME types (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP).

    Verify if a file was uploaded:
        Check if the file exists in $_FILES['file']['tmp_name'].

    Check the MIME type:
        Use mime_content_type() to get the uploaded file's type and confirm it's valid.

    Validate the file extension:
        Compare the file extension (e.g., jpg, png) with a list of allowed extensions.

    Restrict file size:
        Define a maximum file size limit (e.g., 5 MB).

    Check the upload directory:
        Verify if the directory exists.
        If not, create it with mkdir() and set the appropriate permissions.

    Generate a unique file name:
        Prevent file overwrites by appending a unique identifier (e.g., uniqid()).

    Move the uploaded file:
        Use move_uploaded_file() to save the file to the designated directory.

    Return success or failure message:
        Provide feedback on the upload status.
